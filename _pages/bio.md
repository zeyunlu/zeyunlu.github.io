My name is Zeyun Lu (鲁泽沄). I'm from [Zibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zibo){:target="_blank"} of Shandong Province of China, an industrial city in eastern China famous for the birthplace of ancient football ["Cuju" (蹴鞠)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuju){:target="_blank"}. My first name Zeyun (泽沄) means "surging tides on the great lake" in Chinese.

I was born in [Hulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulin){:target="_blank"} of Heilongjiang Province of China, an agricultural town by the [River Ussuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussuri){:target="_blank"}, the border between China and Russia. When I was one year old, my parents moved to Zibo due to work.

I came to the US in 2010 for a high school diploma and an AA degree in Business at Shoreline Community College in Washington. Then, I transferred to University of California, Los Angeles for a BS degree in Mathematics/Economics. In 2016, I obtained my MS in Statistics at University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

Then, I was extremely fortunate to work as a Statistician at the [Biostatistics section](https://sites.usc.edu/atribiostats/){:target="_blank"} of [USC Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI)](https://keck.usc.edu/atri){:target="_blank"} under supervision of Dr. Rema Raman and Dr. Michael Donohue. There, I realized how public health science can benefit people's lives and developed an interest in using statistics to better facilitate medical research.

I'm currently doing my PhD in Biostatistics at Keck School of Medicine of USC with Dr. Nicholas Mancuso. I'm particularly interested in the development of novel statistical methods to better understand genetic architecture of complex diseases. I'm also co-advised by Dr. Alexander Gusev from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School on my perturb-seq project.

I have a great variety of hobbies. I will never get bored reading books (especially detective stories) and studying Chinese history. Despite whether I'm good at them or not, I love playing [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends){:target="_blank"}, Texas hold 'em, [Japanese mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mahjong){:target="_blank"}, [Sheng Ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji){:target="_blank"}, [Football Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager){:target="_blank"}, [San Guo Sha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_the_Three_Kingdoms){:target="_blank"}, and other interesting games. My exercise activities include badminton, snowboarding, hiking, and running. I enjoy Chinese pop music especially by [Eason Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eason_Chan){:target="_blank"}, [Jay Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou){:target="_blank"}, and many other great songs whose lyrics are written by [Albert Leung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Leung){:target="_blank"} and [Wyman Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyman_Wong){:target="_blank"}. Soccer is my favorite sport, and I support [Juventus FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.){:target="_blank"} with all my heart. I watch [Running Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Man_(South_Korean_TV_series)){:target="_blank"} every week. Last but not least, I've always had a dream to be a detective story writer, and hope it could come true someday.

My life is full of His grace, and I thank Him every day!
