My name is Zeyun Lu (鲁泽沄). I'm from [Zibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zibo){:target="_blank"} of [Shandong Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong){:target="_blank"} of China, an industrial city in eastern China famous for the birthplace of ancient football ["Cuju" (蹴鞠)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuju){:target="_blank"}. My first name Zeyun (泽沄) means "surging tides on the great lake" in Chinese.

I was born in [Hulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulin){:target="_blank"} of [Heilongjiang Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilongjiang){:target="_blank"} of China, an agricultural town by the [River Ussuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussuri){:target="_blank"}, the border between China and Russia. When I was one year old, my parents moved to Zibo due to work.

I came to the US in 2010 for a high school diploma and an AA degree in Business at [Shoreline Community College (SCC)](https://www.shoreline.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Then, I transferred to [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} for a BS degree in Mathematics/Economics. In 2016, I obtained my MS in Statistics at [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Then, I was extremely fortunate to work as a Statistician at the [Biostatistics section](https://sites.usc.edu/atribiostats/){:target="_blank"} of [USC Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI)](https://keck.usc.edu/atri){:target="_blank"} under supervision of Dr. Rema Raman and Dr. Michael Donohue. There, I realized how public health science can benefit people's lives (especially after COVID-19!) and developed an interest in using statistics to better facilitate medical research.

I'm currently doing my PhD in Biostatistics at [Keck School of Medicine, USC](https://keck.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"} with [Dr. Nicholas Mancuso](https://www.mancusolab.com/){:target="_blank"}. I am particularly interested in how to better understand genetic architecture for complex traits leveraging summary-based data (e.g. [GWAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study){:target="_blank"}) and other reference panels.

I have a great variety of hobbies. I will never get bored reading books (especially detective stories) and studying Chinese history. Despite whether I'm good at them or not, I love playing [League of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends){:target="_blank"}, Texas hold 'em, [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong){:target="_blank"}, [Sheng Ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji){:target="_blank"}, [Football Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager){:target="_blank"}, [San Guo Sha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_the_Three_Kingdoms){:target="_blank"}, and other interesting games. My exercise activities include singing, dancing, hiking, badminton, and occasionally running. I enjoy Chinese pop music especially by [Eason Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eason_Chan){:target="_blank"}, [Jay Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou){:target="_blank"}, and many other songs whose lyrics are written by [Albert Leung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Leung){:target="_blank"} and [Wyman Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyman_Wong){:target="_blank"}. Soccer is my favorite sport, and I support [Juventus FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.){:target="_blank"} with all my heart. I watch [Running Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Man_(South_Korean_TV_series)){:target="_blank"} every week. I've always had a dream to be a detective story writer, and hope it could come true someday.

My life is full of His grace, and I thank Him every day!
