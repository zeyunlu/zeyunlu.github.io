My name is Zeyun Lu (鲁泽沄). I'm from Zibo of Shandong Province of China, an industrial city in eastern China that is famous for birthplace of ancient football "Cuju" (蹴鞠). My first name Zeyun (泽沄) means "big tides on the large lake" in Chinese.

I was born in Hulin of Heilongjiang Province of Chinese, an agricultural town by the River misuli, the borderline between China and Russia. When I was 1 year old, my parents moved to Zibo due to work.

I came to the US in 2010 for an AA degree in Business at Shoreline Community College. Then, I transferred to University of California, Los Angeles for a BS degree in Mathematics/Economics. In 2016, I obtained my Master of science degree in Statistics at University of California, San Diego.

Then, I was super fortunate to get a job as a Statistician at Alzheimer's Thearuputic Research Insitute of Keck School of Medicine, USC. In there, I realized how public health can benefit people's lives and developed an interest in using statistics to better blah blah.

I am currently doing my PhD in Biostatistics at Keck School of Medicine of USC with Dr. Nicholas Mancuso. I develop statistical methods to better understand the associations between genetic variants and complex diseases.

My life is full of luck and I would like to express my huge gratitude to following people because of either their endless support or important help:
