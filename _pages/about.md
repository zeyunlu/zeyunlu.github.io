Hello! I'm Zeyun Lu (鲁泽沄), a postdoctoral research fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Alexander Gusev](http://gusevlab.org/){:target="_blank"} for my postdoctoral training and to have been mentored by [Dr. Nicholas Mancuso](https://www.mancusolab.com/){:target="_blank"} during my PhD in Biostatistics at Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California. My CV is [here](./assets/pdf/Lu_Zeyun_CV_web.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests focus on three main areas:

  1. **Developing computational causal inference methods** to understand the genetic architecture of complex diseases.
  
  2. **Leveraging deep learning frameworks** to predict perturbation effects on the transcriptome.

  3. **Combining electronic health record data and AI** to advance medical and clinical research.

I’m always excited to discuss my research and scientific topics. Feel free to PM me on X (upper left corner).

I'm from Zibo, Shandong, China. My first name, Zeyun (泽沄), is derived from the verse "His favor is like a cloud of the latter rain (Pr 16:15)" in Chinese.

***In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden. (Col.2:3)***
