Hello World! My name is Zeyun Lu (鲁泽沄). I'm a PhD student in [Biostatistics](https://preventivemedicine.usc.edu/divisions/biostatistics/graduate-programs-in-biostatistics-epidemiology/){:target="_blank"} at [Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California (USC)](https://keck.usc.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interest is to develop statistical methods to better understand the associations between genetic variants and complex diseases. I have very good fortune to be advised by [Dr. Nicholas Mancuso](https://www.mancusolab.com/){:target="_blank"}.

You can find my CV at [here](./assets/pdf/Lu,ZeyunCV.pdf) (last updated on 07/04/2021).

You can DM me on twitter or via my email address [first_name]+[last_name]+[23] AT [gmail]+[dot]+[com].
