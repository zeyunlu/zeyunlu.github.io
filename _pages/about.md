Hello! My name is Zeyun Lu (鲁泽沄). I'm a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California.

My research interest is to develop causal inference methods on the genetic architecture of complex diseases. I have the very good fortune to be advised by [Dr. Nicholas Mancuso](https://www.mancusolab.com/){:target="_blank"}. I'm also co-advised by [Dr. Alexander Gusev](http://gusevlab.org/){:target="_blank"} from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School on one of my dissertation research projects.

You can find my CV [here](./assets/pdf/Lu_Zeyun_CV_web.pdf){:target="_blank"} (last updated on 10/29/2022).

I'm very happy to talk about my research projects and sciences with you. Please feel free to PM me on Twitter (upper left corner).
